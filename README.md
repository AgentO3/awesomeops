# Ansible + ChatOps = AwesomeOps

ChatOps is awesome, by putting tools into the middle of the conversations we make common ops tasks accessible to everybody. Ansible is awesome, it makes describing various ops tasks simple. What happens when we combine the simplicity of Ansible with the power of ChatOps?

AwesomeOps! Imaging being back to access logs with a simple command accessible from a smartphone? Imagin ops with out documentation, not sure how to do something? Just ask in the chatroom and see by others doing! This is the definition of codeification of knowledge. Ansible provides the perfect abstraction to describe server state and common tasks. ChatOps makes these common tasks easily accessible and discoverable.

In this presentation I will show you how to apply DevOps methodolgies with the help of chatops. 


<!--One tenant of a DevOps IT centric culture is the concept of "Codeification of Knowlege". Codeification of Knowlege is about using code to create functional documentation about a particular server state or specific IT proceedures and processes. These functional specs are respeatable and testable. Before that knowledge would have been in an engineers head or Word Document, which either is testable or repeatable. Ansible works very well with "Codeification of Knowlege" by providing a flexible layer of abstraction that is both human readable and writable.-->

<!--So now that all our knowledge is codeified how do we make it accessable and discoverable? It's human nature to pick the tried and true path over the new one. This unless you have someone to guide you down the enlightened path. This is where ChatOps can help. ChatOps is about bringing tools into the chatroom conversation. By bring those tools into the chatroom others learn the commands by seeing. The chatroom becomes a shared terminal and the knowledge codeified in those tools become accessible to all.-->
